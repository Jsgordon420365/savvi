# No-Confirm Rule

## Purpose
Prevent user confirmation prompts for files that are merely logging/documenting what has been done.

## Scope
Files that should NOT require confirmation:
- Documentation files (`.md` files) that only update progress tracking, timestamps, or completion status
- Log files (`.log` files)
- Progress tracking files (`TODO.md`, `cursor.md`, `README.md`, `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`, etc.)
- Files that only update timestamps or completion checkboxes
- Files that document completed tasks without changing functionality

## When to Auto-Accept
Auto-accept changes to markdown files when:
- Only updating progress percentages or completion status
- Only adding timestamps to completed tasks
- Only updating "Last Updated" fields
- Only marking tasks as completed with checkboxes
- Only updating progress bars or status indicators
- Only documenting what was done (not changing functionality)

## When to Still Require Confirmation
Still require confirmation for:
- Code changes (`.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, etc.)
- Configuration changes (`.yaml`, `.json`, `.env`, etc.)
- Structural changes to documentation (new sections, major rewrites)
- Changes that modify functionality or behavior

## Implementation
When updating documentation files that only log progress:
1. Make the changes directly
2. Do not wait for user confirmation
3. Proceed with commits and updates
4. Only ask for confirmation if the change affects functionality or structure
